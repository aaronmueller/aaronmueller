### Aaron Mueller

<!--
I'm a PhD candidate at Johns Hopkins University and visiting researcher at New York University. I'm interested in NLP, robust generalization, interpreting deep neural models, and multilinguality. My recent work has focused on causal probing methods, evaluating the inductive biases of pre-trained models, and understanding what, exactly, pre-training teaches models about the underlying structure of language.
